usage: hashly [option option=parameter ...] <source> [destination]

Source refers to the root directory from which root relative paths will be based.
If source is omitted, the current working directory will be used.
If destination is omitted, hashed files will be written alongside the source files.
A list of files can be piped in to hashly from stdin.

options:
  -h, --help               Print help (this message) and exit.
  -v, --verbose            Emit verbose output
  -i, --include            A globbing expression. If specified, only matching files will be processed.
  -e, --exclude            A globbing expression. Any matching files will not be processed. Takes precedence over --include.
  -m, --manifest-format    The format for the manifest file. Currently supports "json" or "tab" (tab delimited). 
                               Default is "json"
  -b, --base-dir           Specifies the path to a folder. If specified, all paths included in the manifest will be 
                               prefixed with this path.
  --manifest-path          Specifies a path for the manifest file. If not specified, the manifest is named "manifest.{ext}"
                               and is placed in the destination directory root.
  -a, --amend              Instructs hashly to amend an existing manifest, where it would normally delete and recreate it
                               from scratch. This is useful for incrementally adding to a large filesystem
                               without incurring the performance penalty of reprocessing existing files.
  -s, --skip-css           Skip replacement of image paths in CSS files. If not specified, relative 
                               (and root relative) image paths will be replaced with the hashed version.
  -q, --quickhash          Use the file size for binary files instead of the file contents. This makes processing large binary
                               files extremely quick, though at a (extremely slight) risk that a hashcode will not change when a 
                               file is updated.
  --ignore-errors          Ignore errors. Otherwise, hashly will abort on the first error.
  -c, --clean              Deletes the manifest and all files generated by hashly
  --clean-old              Deletes files that aren't in the manifest and are older than the specified number of days.
